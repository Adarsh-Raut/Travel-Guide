Travel-Guide is a React app to help people who travel to guide them to different attractions, hotels and restaurants in that location. You can also filter hotels, attractions and restaurants according to their reviews.

## Step to follow
Firstly, you have to install all the dependancies so, run this command
    
    npm install

API's needed for the app -->

Travel advisor rapid api --> https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/travel-advisor/

Google maps api --> https://developers.google.com/maps
